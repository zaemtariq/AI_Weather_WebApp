## 🤖 AI Insights

The AI layer analyzes weather conditions such as:

* **Rainfall Probability** → Suggests umbrella or raincoat.
* **Temperature Extremes** → Advises on clothing (light/heavy).
* **Wind & Humidity** → Recommends outdoor or indoor activities.

This makes the forecast **actionable**, not just informational.
